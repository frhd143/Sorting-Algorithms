# Sorting Algorithms Implementation
This repository contains implementation of different sorting algorithms in Python. 

## Overview
### Note! In order to test the code with large amount of data, I `random.sample`. You can basically remove those lines if you don't want them. 

The implemented algorithms include:

- Quicksort using the first element as the pivot
- Quicksort using median of three as the pivot
- d-Heapsort
- Merge Sort with insertion sort as a hybrid sort for small subarrays

## Usage
